# Exercice for Plug'Heur

Welcome here ! Let's me introduce my version of your exercice.

## Prerequisites
- Git
- Node
- A web browser

## Instructions

First open your terminal app and type:

``` sh
cd my-folder
git clone https://github.com/Fafacochere/plugheur-exercice.git
cd plugheur-exercice
```

I recommand you to open a second terminal window for the next steps (1 for the back / 1 for the front)

You have to launch the back first
``` sh
cd back-express
npm install
npm start
```

After that, it will be the same for the Front-End part in the second terminal
``` sh
cd back-express
npm install
npm start
```

Once all is setted, follow the link http://localhost:3000/ and see the result
